"R2V1S6MQGZ35VO","savedbygrace","I’ve had the Ring Battery Doorbell for a few months now, and it has completely transformed the way I secure and monitor my home. As someone who values both convenience and safety, this doorbell has been a game-changer in terms of functionality, ease of use, and peace of mind.First, the installation was incredibly straightforward. I was able to set it up myself in about 20 minutes, thanks to the clear instructions and the fact that it's wire-free. The battery lasts surprisingly long too, even with regular motion detection and video use. I’ve only had to recharge it a couple of times, and the process is quick and easy.The video quality is excellent—crystal clear even in low light, which is essential for those early morning or late-night deliveries. The wide-angle lens gives a clear view of who’s at the door, and the motion detection feature is spot-on. I get instant alerts on my phone whenever someone is approaching, and I love that I can see and speak to visitors directly through the app. Whether I’m at home or out running errands, I can easily communicate with delivery people or guests, which is great for convenience and security.Another feature I love is the two-way audio. The sound quality is surprisingly clear on both ends, and I’ve been able to have full conversations with delivery drivers, neighbors, and even the occasional solicitor. The built-in siren also offers an added layer of security—if I ever feel unsafe, I can sound it directly from the app.The Ring app itself is intuitive and user-friendly, with everything you need in one place. You can review video clips, adjust settings, and even link it with other smart devices for an integrated security system. It’s so easy to use, even for someone who isn’t particularly tech-savvy.In summary, the Ring Battery Doorbell has exceeded my expectations. It’s reliable, easy to install, and provides real-time alerts that help keep my home secure. The video quality and two-way communication make it stand out among other doorbell cameras, and I feel much more confident knowing I can monitor my doorstep from anywhere. If you're looking for a high-quality, user-friendly doorbell camera that doesn’t require complicated wiring, this is definitely worth the investment!","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2024","100% worth the peace of mind","5.0 out of 5 stars","","4","Venetian Bronze","1 Doorbell"

It’s Vernice to have the security of knowing who is at the door- and to be able to speak without having to open the door.  The price is good- I bought it on sale.  The design is sleek and attractive.

"R2928F417PBRGU","FrannyTW","First 2 days review:This product has great camera quality and because of the fish lens eliminates blind spots, even when placed at an angle.The Battery life is great considering I have it set to highly motion sensitivity, and it only loses 1-2%, at most 3% of battery per day.If you don’t buy the extra adhesive place holder for this product, which I didn’t, you need a drill capable of drilling 4 holes through the surface you’d like to place it on. I marked a sharpee line on the drill bit just how far the wall plug goes so I knew how deep to drill. There is a tutorial for this on the app as well.Charging takes about an hour or 2 it seems so whenever I’m at home about once a month I can give it a charge, maybe less frequently than that considering its strong battery life.The ring app works smoothly and the lag is only about one second. Video and Audio quality are definitely a plus.A price of $50 and change per camera seems a fair deal in exchange for the additional layer of security. Especially with an upcoming holiday season.I’ll update this review when I learn about the subscription services and what it entails.","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2024","Great Video Quality and Battery Life","5.0 out of 5 stars","","41","Satin Nickel","1 Doorbell"
"R1UFQRWIKTYDOQ","Cora Mercy","Bought this and haven't put it outside yet, but we had it on the counter to test it out in the meantime. Charged it once and it's been over a month of constant use and it still hasn't died yet. It was super easy to create an account for myself and my roommate. It picked up on the cats walking across the room multiple times a day. I'd say it's the best sensitivity of any doorbell cameras I've had experience with. The video quality is good and the sound quality was way better than expected. I talked to the cats and they could tell it was me and where the sound was coming from. I talked to my roommate through it and we could understand each other easily.The free trial ran out, but the plans aren't expensive. The most basic one still gives all the great functions and is only $5/mo.

"R2BM6KD5Y8IA1X","Eric B","To start, buy the wired unit that comes with a rechargeable battery if you have an existing doorbell. Yes the 10 to 24 volt from your doorbell transformer will keep the battery charged. Yes the Ring doorbell will activate your existing doorbell chime so do not buy a separate chime. Don’t panic when you first wire it to existing doorbell wires. Part of the install process is for th Ring doorbell to look for an existing chime and initialize or whatever it does to know it is there. Putting this in my review as I had a hard time finding this info on the vendor sites or any reviews.Setup is easy. The hardest part for my install was getting the mounting plate to be flat enough for the Ring doorbell to click into this mount. I have a stucco wall which creates flex in the mounting plate when attached. To get it to click I had to remove one of four screws and loosing others so that I could get my fingers on the back of the mounting plate to be able to get it flat to click to the doorbell. The mounting plate is plastic and easily flexes which will not allow the security snap to click into a locked position. Then to get the doorbell to not move, I added a shim behind.Installed the doorbell is a bit clunky looking but video is good and works well taking video in the dark.Hope this helps others.","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2024","Here is info hard to find","4.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81cvusQ5iZL.jpg","47","Venetian Bronze","1 Doorbell"

"R3NVF8DV29QDBL","K. A.","The device itself worked great (5 stars) until it croaked after I connected a solar charger to it. It started charging perfectly (blue ring lighted and blinking).The next day I realised that there weren't any notifications, and when I checked, it was ""offline"".No response from the bell button.....it was dead.I removed it and plugged in the regular charger........nothing.....(yes, the charger is good.......the same one that was used to full-charge it when I got it).That's it for me and RING. I'm gone.If you opt for a solar charger, use one from RING themselves. Connecting anything else is at your own risk (and probable expense).Shalom.Update (Edit).So.......Ring reached out to me concerning my review. Phone calls, emails, ect.I explained the situation described above, and they promised to send me a new door bell, which they did.When I was about to set up the new one I noticed that the old (dead) one was showing full-charge on the app. I tried a reset (held both the orange And the bell buttons down simultaneously) and it came on. It came on and worked perfectly. I reinstalled it to its mount, and it's been going well ever since (approx a month).The new (unopened) one? I promised the rep to ship it back to them. They ""can't provide a shipping label"" which they initially promised, and told me to keep the new one. I dont need nor want it. I tried to ship it back myself, but I'm not going to pay $140.00 to UPS it back to the States (I'm in the Caribbean).So......5 stars 🌟 it is for ring.

"RPMBPM2R4VODZ","Anne","I have wanted one of these for a while but my (now) ex didn't want any electronics taking over 'normal' things in the house. I ordered this on a black Friday deal, and I couldn't be happier. It charges quickly and easily with a cord in the house. The set up is easy, I followed the app after downloading it. It is simple to use and comes with a month free trial of the monthly fee options. I love this, because I wasn't sure if I wanted it or not.The install was easy. Four screws drilled in to hold it in place. You use a small orange piece of plastic to pop it off to charge it. It has been installed for three days now and the battery percentage is at 99%. This is with us me and my son being home, going outside 4 or 5 times, getting a few deliveries each day (and one at night!). So there will normally be even less times it is set off and use battery life. So far, I'm impressed with the battery. This area sits in full sun from about 2 PM to sunset so I'm very curious if this will affect anything.I will update this review soon, with how long the battery lasts, which ring plan I choose, and if the sun affects it at all.

"R10IXP8MVIYOHZ","Lori Hawkins","This doorbell has a very long battery life so far.  I have had it over a month and have not even had to charge it yet.  I got it at a great price as well.  I also think the video quality is pretty good.  There are a few negatives though.  I probably wouldn’t have bought it if I had known I would have to pay $50/year just to keep all videos to view later.  And if you don’t get it, it tells you someone was at your door and you are left in suspense to who it was.  I don’t like that at all.  It also doesn’t come with a chime, you have to buy one for $35.  It also drives me a little crazy because it alerts every time me and my husband goes in and out the door but there really is no way around that unless you disarm it and then what is the use anyway.  Overall I like it but think the subscription should be cheaper.  I also hope the battery lasts.  I would love to have gotten the wired one but live in an older brick home without a pre-existing wired bell.  I  don’t know if it would be possible to drill through the brick to wire it.

"R3VF8DJL9CRGCG","Bryan","My original Ring Doorbell (purchased 3/19) died, and this one was pretty affordable so I just ordered it.  It’s terrific, and the picture is much improved.I’m taking off a star because, apparently in an effort to make the construction cheaper, they changed the design in a way that will make re-charging a PITA.  On the original, the connections for a wired doorbell were on the wall bracket (along with electronic components), so to take the unit off to charge (I’ve had to do it about 2x per year) you just popped it off, super easy.On the new unit, the wall bracket is just a piece of plastic (no electronics), and you need to screw the wired doorbell wires directly to the doorbell.  Not a huge deal to set up, but it means that every time I need to take the doorbell off to charge it (the charging port is on the back), I’ll need to unscrew the wires (and then re-attach them).  This will make the re-charging process a fair bit more cumbersome.That said, I like the doorbell and the ring app is well designed and easy to use.  I just wish they hadn’t designed in a re-charging hassle in an effort to save a bit of $$.","Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2024","Great Doorbell, but new version much harder to re-charge than original","4.0 out of 5 stars","","277","Venetian Bronze","1 Doorbell"

"R3OS9Y2QW4NHHR","Stephen54","We've had the Ring Doorbell camera for just over a month now. Some things I've learned:Do not expect this to pick up license plates - you can't even read the front plates of our cars parked 10 feet away. There are other home camera packages sold on Amazon that I plan on getting for better home surveillance.This is not a 24 hour recording device. It only starts recording once it picks something up or if you go into live view, and there's a slight lag to it, meaning the deliver guy might be walking away by the time it started recording.You may have to be creative in mounting it. I have siding, so it wouldn't be on a completely flat surface. I cut a piece of pvc board to get full contact.If you don't want to mess with recharging it, wire it into your existing bell wires. The terminal screws are right on the back. I did not realize they were the terminals screws at first, because of how they looked. You don't need to remove any covers to get to them. It will charge very slowly (as designed), but eventually it will get to 100%.You get a 30 day free subscription when you buy this. Ours just ran out, and it was very telling of how this product is designed for you to need the subscription. It is not just that you lose the recording of videos. I could live with that. All day I've been getting tons of motion alerts. It seems to be picking up cars driving down the street that are 30 feet out from the front door. When you are on the free subscription, it has person identification, meaning it isn't alerting you for cars driving by. When you are off the subscription, it alerts you for everything and just says motion alert for it all. I kept adjusting the sensitivity down trying to get it to not pick up cars and it seems like that was doing nothing. So, we caved, and paid for a subscription. As of right now it's $49.99 if you pay for the whole year, for one device. It's almost $10 more if you want to go month to month.It is nice having a camera at the front door, and it's nice to be at work and be able to see the front yard. I know the moment a package is delivered - sometimes you don't know even when you are home. I set up an automated message which starts talking after a few seconds of someone pushing the doorbell. It tells them we aren't home and that they can leave a message. This has worked well for solicitors, as they seem to leave as soon as they hear the message. We no longer have to peak out the window to see who's at the door. It just bothers me that they strip away all the features if you don't get on a subscription plan.","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2024","Consider the total cost","3.0 out of 5 stars","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zsu9-Ge2L.jpg","111","Venetian Bronze","1 Doorbell"

"R2PAFZ2SOALKBD","Avid book reader","If we weren’t having issues with our ring 4, we would have just kept that one. This doesn’t seem to be much of an upgrade yet. Yes, the field of vision is significantly more than the 4. The night vision seems to be about the same. So far, the biggest problem was mounting it. The mounting bracket holes are not in the same spot as the 4. So we drilled new holes. The mounting bracket has two hooks to hang it on top, then it’s supposed to snap in place on the bottom. It took over two hours to finally get it to snap in place. Terrible design. We installed it on brick, and the bracket has to be perfectly flat for it to snap in properly. We ended up using washers and put a tool under the bottom to get it to finally snap into place. Oh, and the battery is built into the device. It’s on a trickle charge, so hopefully it’ll only have to be charge when the weather gets cold like the old one. Hopefully we won’t have to charge it at all, because it’s going to be a pain to take it off and put it back on the bracket.Adding a star for customer service!!!

Charged it up & mounted on given bracket in no time. The door bell allows many customizations wrt motion detection as well as integrate these customizations to the ring security system mode.
